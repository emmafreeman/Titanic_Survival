# Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction

This was my first project for the Data Science Immersive prorgram at General Assembly.

Working with the Titanic survivors dataset in a PostgreSQL database, I used SQL and Pandas to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis, conducted hypothesis testing using Scipy, and visualized the results using Seaborn.
